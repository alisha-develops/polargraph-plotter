# polargraph-plotter
This is my first hands-on project as a prospective engineer — a Polargraph Plotter built from scratch to explore electronics, motors, and coding. It uses stepper motors controlled by an Arduino to draw patterns on a vertical surface, combining hardware and software in a single system.
